### I don't work in a bank :bank:

This repository contains an example of a gRPC application that demonstrates the interaction between a bank and a customer's wallet. The application is designed with two main components: a sender and a receiver. This example serves as a practical guide for understanding the implementation of gRPC communication in a real-world scenario.
